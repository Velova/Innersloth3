  <p>Join your crewmates in a multiplayer game of teamwork and betrayal!

    Play online or over local wifi with 4-10 players as you attempt to hold your spaceship together and return back to civilization. But beware...as there may be an alien impostor aboard!
    
    One crewmate has been replaced by a parasitic shapeshifter. Their goal is to eliminate the rest of the crew before the ship reaches home. The Impostor will sabotage the ship, sneak through vents, deceive, and frame others to remain anonymous and kill off the crew.
    
    While everyone is fixing up the ship, no one can talk to maintain anonymity. Once a body is reported, the surviving crew will openly debate who they think The Impostor is. The Impostor's goal is to pretend that they are a member of the crew. If The Impostor is not voted off, everyone goes back to maintaining the ship until another body is found. If The Impostor is voted off, the crew wins!

    <p>Dig through the center of the Earth, starting right in your backyard all the way to China!

      Upgrade your digger and plunge through 13 layers of the Earth to prove that if you dig deep enough, you really will make it to the other side. And make it back in time for dinner!
      
      Dig 2 China was released in 2015 and is available on the Google Play store and the Apple App store.</p>

    <p>
      It's all the Henry Stickmin games in one place! That's right! Breaking the Bank, Escaping the Prison, Stealing the Diamond, Infiltrating the Airship, and Fleeing the Complex, plus a new game that will be the Henry Stickmin finale.

      Breaking the Bank has been completely redone. All the previous games have newly remastered art and sound. To top it all off, a new Henry Stickmin game was developed to complete the series, Completing the Mission! CtM is 3x bigger than Fleeing the Complex and features 16 Endings and 164 Fails!
      
      All the Henry Stickmin games, including the new CtM, will be part of The Henry Stickmin Collection! Available August 7th 9am PDT on Steam! If you're interested in seeing some development logs and listening to the music from the HS games, please check out Puffballs' Newgrounds!
